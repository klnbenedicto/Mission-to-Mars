# Mission-to-Mars
In this challenge, I created a web app to scrape data and images from the web about Mars and feature them on a single page. At the top of the page, underneath the "Mission to Mars" title, I used bootstrap to change the color of the "Scrape New Data" button to red to mimic the color of the planet. When this button is pushed, the latest data will be scraped from the web to populate the page. In the first section, "Latest Mars News" pulls the most recent headline and article summary from the Mars NASA news site redplanetscience.com. The Featured Mars Image comes from spaceimages-mars.com. The Mars Facts table is scraped from Galaxy Facts (galaxyfacts-mars.com) and returns a side by side data comparison of Mars and Earth. Finally, images of Mars' hemispheres are featured at the bottom of the page and captioned with which hemisphere is represented. One of the bootstrap modifications I made was to make the image a circle because it gives a more 3D feel.
